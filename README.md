I stumbled upon a fascinating dog breed dataset on Kaggle. I selected this dataset due to my personal interest in dogs and a curiosity about how distinct breed characteristics might influence their lifespan. In my analysis, I employed the age and size variables of the dogs from the dataset. Since each entry contains two reference values, I worked with four data points. Ultimately, I opted to utilize square and random play for the purpose of comparison.
